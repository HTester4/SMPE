*** Bananas exportation

**** Data
- [ ] Type of graphic adapted
- [ ] Interpolation makes sense
- [ ] Sufficient number of points
- [ ] Building method clear
- [ ] Confidence intervals visualized
- [ ] Appropriate steps for histograms
- [ ] Histograms visualize probabilities

**** Graphical objects
- [ ] Graphical objects are readable on any support
- [ ] Standard color range
- [ ] Axis identified and labelled
- [ ] Scales units are explicit
- [ ] No ambiguity when curves cross
- [ ] Grid helps reading

**** Annotation
- [ ] Axis are labelled by quantities
- [ ] Labels of the axis are clear, and self contained
- [ ] Units are indicated on the axis
- [ ] Axes are oriented fron bottom-left to top-right
- [ ] Origin should be (0,0), if not it should be clearly justified
- [ ] No Hole on the axes
- [ ] the order's of graph/histogram bar is based on classical ordering
- [ ] Curves and Bar has legend

**** Information
- [ ] Curves on the same scale
- [ ] Less than 6 curves
- [ ] Compare curves on same graphics
- [ ] A curve cannot be removed without reducing infos
- [ ] The graphic gives relevant infos
- [ ] If showing average, don't forget the error bars
- [ ] It is not possible to remove object without altering readability

**** Context
- [ ] All symbols used are defined and references
- [ ] The graphics is the most appropriate representation for the data
- [ ] The graphic has a title
- [ ] The title is meaningful and self contained
- [ ] The graphic is referenced in text
- [ ] The text comment the figure
